                            Australia, the world's smallest continent and its largest island, draws its name from the Latin term "AUSTRALIAS,"
                            signifying the southern region. Legends speak of an "unknown land of the south." Often dubbed the "lucky country," Australia boasts a thriving economy,
                            political stability, and a quality of life that garners envy. Its captivating landscapes have earned it international renown.
                            Renowned for its high standard of living, Australia proves to be a splendid destination for both residence and business endeavors.

                            As of July 1, 2012, a new points system has been introduced for various Skilled Migration Visas.
                            For Skilled Subclasses, the qualifying score now stands at 65 points.
                            This alteration seeks to facilitate the immigration process for skilled individuals eager to contribute their expertise to the Australian landscape.

                            The premier choice among immigrants aspiring to settle in Australia is the permanent resident visa introduced to address the escalating need for skilled labor.
                            The Australian immigration system employs a point-based assessment, wherein applicants must amass a minimum of 65 points across categories including Age, Qualifications,
                            Language Ability, Experience, and more. Only when an applicant meets this minimum point threshold and also aligns with the criteria listed in the Skilled Occupation List (SOL)
                            can they proceed with an application for immigration to Australia.
                            Individuals who meet these minimum requirements aren't obligated to secure sponsorship from Australian states or territories, streamlining the pathway to immigration.

                            For individuals whose occupations aren't featured on the Skilled Occupation List, the option of seeking permanent residence in Australia
                            remains viable through the Skilled Nominated Visa (subclass 190). However, applicants in this category must obtain sponsorship from a specific
                            state or territory within Australia. Meeting the minimum point score of 65 remains a prerequisite for eligibility in this category.
                            This visa pathway allows individuals to gain permanent residency in Australia with the support and sponsorship of a particular state or territory.

                            5 points if they receive nomination from an Australian State or Territory. It's important to note that while this visa
                            option provides a pathway to permanent residency, recipients are required to reside in the sponsoring state or territory for
                            a period of 2 years. This residency condition aims to facilitate regional development and integration, fostering a connection
                            between skilled immigrants and specific regions within Australia.
