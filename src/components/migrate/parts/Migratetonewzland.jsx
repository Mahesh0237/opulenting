                            Referred to as the Skilled Migrant Category (SMC), this program serves as a gateway for individuals possessing sought-after skills and experience
                            to relocate to New Zealand. This initiative caters to the nation's requirement for specific expertise. New Zealand's immigration process operates on
                            a point-based system, wherein factors like age, employment history, educational qualifications, and a job offer in a skilled occupation contribute to
                            the overall points tally. Meeting the specified point threshold under
                            this system qualifies individuals for consideration within the Skilled Migrant Category, thereby facilitating their immigration to New Zealand.

                            To qualify for immigration to New Zealand, applicants must adhere to certain eligibility criteria.
                            Among these, the applicant should not exceed the age of 45. Proficiency in the English language is also a vital requirement,
                            ensuring effective communication and integration within the country. These stipulations are fundamental to the immigration process and
                            determine an applicant's suitability for resettlement in New Zealand.

                            The immigration process for New Zealand involves the submission of an Expression of Interest (EOI) by the applicant,
                            aiming to accumulate points based on various factors. Only when the applicant manages to secure more than 100 points will their
                            application be included in the EOI pool. Applications with a score of 140 or higher are prioritized for selection from the pool.
                            It's essential to note that an EOI application holds validity for a period of 6 months. If the application isn't chosen within this timeframe,
                            it will expire and become inactive.

                            Upon submission of the Expression of Interest (EOI) to the New Zealand immigration authority, the provided details are subject to verification.
                            If the information is deemed credible and meets the requirements, the immigration authority issues an Invitation to Apply (ITA). Once an applicant receives this
                            invitation, they are required to submit the necessary documents and information as part of the subsequent stage to successfully finalize the immigration process.
                            This comprehensive approach ensures that only eligible and qualified candidates progress through the immigration process in New Zealand.
