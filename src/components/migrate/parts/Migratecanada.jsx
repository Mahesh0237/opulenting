                            Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) has introduced the Express Entry system to effectively manage applications for permanent residency.
                            This system extends an invitation to individuals worldwide who meet the criteria of the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), Canadian Experience Class (CEC),
                            Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP), or a segment of the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP).
                            Successful applicants will receive an Invitation to Apply for Permanent Residency from the authorities.

                        <Text size={16} ta="justify">
                            The prerequisites to secure an invitation differ based on the specific program. For eligibility under the FSWP and FSTP,
                            candidates must have a job offer sanctioned by the competent Canadian authorities. Meanwhile, those seeking Permanent Residency through
                            the PNP route must attain a state nomination, and individuals applying under the Canadian Experience Class must align with the selection criteria outlined for the program.
                            This comprehensive approach ensures that diverse avenues exist for skilled individuals to pursue permanent residency in Canada.
