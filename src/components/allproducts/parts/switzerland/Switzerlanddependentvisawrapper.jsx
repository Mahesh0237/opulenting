                                    Residents of Switzerland who hold a valid resident permit and are currently living and working
                                    in the country have the opportunity to bring their family members to live with them through the
                                    Switzerland Dependent Visa category. This long-stay visa allows resident permit or employment
                                    visa holders to apply for a Dependant visa for their spouses or children below 18 years of age.
                                    To qualify for this visa, the sponsor needs to demonstrate a stable financial history and
                                    sufficient balance in their account to support the application of their dependents.
                                    The duration of stay for the dependents is limited and is determined by the validity of the primary applicant's visa.
