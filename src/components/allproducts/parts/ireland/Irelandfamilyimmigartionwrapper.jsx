                                    The Ireland Family Immigration program is designed to facilitate the reunion of employment permit holders
                                    with their family members. Through this family reunification initiative, dependents and spouses of employment
                                    permit holders can apply for a work permit without undergoing the mandatory labor market test.

                                    Eligibility extends to unmarried dependents, including children or relatives of the employment permit holder,
                                    provided they are under 18 years of age. For spouses, there is no age restriction, as long as the marriage is
                                    legally recognized. This program serves to promote family unity and support among employment permit holders by
                                    enabling their family members to work in Ireland without the customary labor market scrutiny.
