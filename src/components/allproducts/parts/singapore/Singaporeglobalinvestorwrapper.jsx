                                    While the process of attaining permanent residence through the Global Investor Program (GIP) follows
                                    a relatively straightforward path, it's important to note that it can sometimes be time-consuming. The applicant is required to navigate
                                    a series of steps that involve submitting an e-application form containing pertinent profile details to the relevant authorities.
                                    This digital application is supported by physical copies of the required documents. Subsequently, successful candidates are requested to participate in an interview.
                                    The timeline for this process usually spans between two to four months, culminating in the interview invitation.

                                    Once the application is reviewed and meets the stipulated criteria, an Approval in Principle is issued to the applicant.
                                    This initial approval holds a validity period of six months. During this time frame, the applicant is expected to execute
                                    the necessary investments as outlined in the chosen investment plan. Furthermore, documentary evidence substantiating the
                                    investment must be provided within the same six-month window. This two-step procedure—initial approval followed by the
                                    investment fulfillment—is designed to ensure that the applicant aligns with the program's requirements and intentions.
