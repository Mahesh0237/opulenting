                            <Text size={16} ta="justify">South Africa is a country with the continuous growth of the economy and production sector. The government of South Africa conjointly realised that Critical skills and demand for the workforce are required to assist growth and to support the economic process of the multi-coloured nation, which they might have to compel from outside the country's borders. Knowing their needs, and lacking qualified and competency to attain this, and that they need the skilled workforce in varied positions had to implement these Critical skills. For this reason, they utilise several foreigners. Therefore, if you are not a South African, you need to apply for a Work Visa.</Text>
                            <Text size={16} ta="justify">A unique set of skills is estimable to the South African critical skill sector that brings worth socially, economically or in any surroundings within which they are going to operate.

                            <Text size={16} ta="justify">The Government of South Africa has enforced the important Skills allowed. This Critical Skill visa aims to attract those in other countries, having bright talent and skill in specific areas requiring development on South African shores. SA is the quickest growing countries on the African continent with the foremost liberal laws; these qualified migrants become the strongest country's development boom. Work visas are not as complex as they seem to appear, and tactlessly most firms do often not understand this. The South African organisation wants a relevant candidate to confirm applicant's skills and/or qualifications in writing. If you have an academic degree in an exceedingly specific field and or have written articles on his field, this tends to gain an edge for higher approval of the application. If you seemingly are appointed, they clear you from your former job. </Text>
